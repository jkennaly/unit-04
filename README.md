## Phrase Hunter

### Starting the Game

Phrase Hunter loads with a start screen that has one button. Click it to start the game. The same screen will load after the game ends. The color will be different and there will be a message depending on whether the game was won or lost, but there will still just be the start button.

### Playing the Game

Phrase Hunter is a browser-based game with gameplay similar to hangman. The user enters letters either via the onscreen keyboard or the regular physical keyboard. If the letter is part of the phrase, all cases of the letter are revealed. If the letter is not part of the phrase, a life heart is removed.

### Ending the game

The game ends when either all the letters in the phrase have been revealed (this is a win) or the fifth life heart is removed (this is a loss). After the game ends, the game board is cleared and a message of congratulations or sympathy appears depending on the game result. 

## Graphical Styling

This game was built from a template, with several styling changes made.

### Color unification

The same background color is used for correct keys, correct letters in the phrase, and the background color for a won game. The incorrect keys and the lost background color were also unified.

### Onscreen keyboard

Borders were added to keys in the onscreen keyboard.
